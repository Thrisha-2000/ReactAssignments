1) Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
2) They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
3) Components come in two types, Class components and Function components
4) A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code.
5) Components can be nested inside other components.

Example Of Functional Component:

function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>
}

Example Of Class Component:

class Welcome extends React.Component
{
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name} </h1>
    }
}
